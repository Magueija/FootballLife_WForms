# Football Life

These days, there are some clubs where their organization is not the best and they also have limited funds to help them, so I decided to apply for this to change. Despite being a very simple one, it will be accessible and easy to understand for all clubs to have access to.
The application was named “Football Life”, because it is based on the life that a football club has and the life/happiness that this sport brings to people.

### Language and Technologies
This program was developed in C#, in Visual Studio 2019, in Windows Forms and has a database created in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18.
